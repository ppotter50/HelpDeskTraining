  CAEN Help Desk Training
</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the CAEN Help Desk! This site will serve as a introduction to and training for your duties at the CAEN Help Desk.
</p>

<p>
    If you are a returning student please go to the <a href='ReturningStudents.html'>returning student training</a> page.
</p>

<p>
  The CAEN Help Desk currently serves as the front line of IT service at the College of Engineering. We are the first point of contact for people experiencing errors or having issues with CAEN services. Our job is to help these people as best we can. This can either mean handling the issue yourself or relaying the issue to one of the departments in CAEN that can better handle the issue. In this training you should learn how to both troubleshoot an issue and attempt to fix it yourself and evaluate whether an issue is outside of the scope of your responsibilities and should be relayed to a more specialized team.
</p>

<p>
   You are coming to the Help Desk at a very interesting time; the Help Desk is being absorbed by the Student Computing Environment (SCE) team and we are redesigning the Help Desk. Its responsibilities and role at the University will be changing while you are here. This means the aforementioned "scope of your responsibilities" will be changing. While these changes are not yet well defined, you can expect that you will be responsible for many more technical issues and will become more involved with the backend for many of the services CAEN provides.
</p>

<p>
  Without further ado, let's get into it.
</p>

  <summary style="font-size: 145%;">
    <strong>Documentation</strong>
  </summary>

  <p>
    Currently CAEN provides a great deal of documentation that is intended to explain the services we provide. Since it is likely that you do not know all of this documentation, you should spend a significant amount of time in your early employment at the Help Desk reading this documentation and becoming very familiar with it. Questions that can be answered within this documentation are 100% <strong>your responsibility</strong>. It will be expected that you can answer these questions without refering to the full-time staff.
  </p>

  <p>
    Does this mean we expect you to have the documentation memorized? Well kind of, eventually, but initially, no it does not.
  </p>

  <p>
  Does this mean we expect you to search the documentation for answers to questions you don't think you have the answer to? <strong>Yes, absolutely it does.</strong> Anytime you don't know the answer to a question, take a minute and search the documentation for an answer. You may feel as though you are making the customer wait, but that is okay. The amount of time it takes you to search through the documentation is much shorter than the amount of time it will take for one of the full-time teams to get to the issue and set aside time to address it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>There are three main sources of documentation:</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://caenfaq.engin.umich.edu/'>The CAEN Knowledge Base</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a public source of information that CAEN has published detailing a great deal of the services CAEN provides. This is the most valuble resource at your disposal and should be the first thing you consult when you have any questions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note: Since this is a public site, you can send links to this site to customers to help explain things to the customer.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://caen.engin.umich.edu'>The CAEN Homepage</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    In the drop-down menus on the top the the CAEN homepage there is more information on the services we provide. Much of this is a rehashing of the information in the Knowledge Base but there are some details presented here that may not be in the Knowledge Base. This should be your second consultation when trying to solve an issue you do not currently know how to fix.
  </p>

  <p>
    Important links to note on this page:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
     Under "About" there is a link that reads "Departmental IT Support Staff," this provides a list of the departmental IT contacts for all of the major departments in the College of Engineering
    </li>
    <li>
    Under "Help & Support" on the left hand side there is a link to the CAEN "Service Status" page, this will provide you with an up-to-date list of any outages or degraded services CAEN is currently aware of
    </li>
    <li>
      Under the same section is a link to "News & Announcements," here is where you can see information about all of the major changes coming to CAEN. This will often be a great place to refer people when they are confused about or unaware of a change in CAENs operations
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <em>Note: Since this is a public site, you can send links to this site to customers to help explain things to the customer.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/Main_Page'>Help Desk Wiki</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is the Help Desk's internal documentation written for students, by students (mostly). This documentation is old and infrequently updated, so take caution when referencing this documentation. If you can find the information elsewhere it is recommended that you rely on that information rather than that provided in the Wiki.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Wiki is still a great resource for referencing Help Desk policies and procedures. Any time you are questioning the steps to opening the Help Desk, or how to work the phones (suprisingly complicated), or how to open a new CAEN account or other such issues consulting the Help Desk Wiki should be the first step. If you look hard enough there is even a comprehensive guide to performing a spinning hook kick.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Note: Since this is an internal site you will not be able to provide customers links to these pages.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    One more link:
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href='https://wiki.med.umich.edu/display/UMHSHELPDESK'>HITS Documentation</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is a link to the Health Information Technology & Services (HITS) Knowledgebase. We're not sure yet how much this link will be used/how much info from this site (if any) you should know. Keep it in mind and stay tuned for more info about it!

     <strong>Help Desk Policies</strong>
   </summary>
   <p>
    <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/Policies_%26_Rules'>General Help Desk Policies</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong><em text-decoration="underline">It is very important that you understand and follow the policies listed in the above link!!!</em></strong>
   </p>
  <p>
    A general rule of thumb is to ensure the supervisors remain updated on all changes or issues, most prominently this applies to (but s not limited to) changes or issues with the schedule. This means you are required to email them if you are going to miss a shift, if you are late for a shift, or if someone is covering a shift for you.
  </p>
   <p>
    Make sure you always follow opening, closing, and on-shift procedures.  
   </p>

   <p>
    <em>That said</em>, note the following errata, policy details that are <strong>outdated or missing from the Wiki:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Notes are no longer taken at Help Desk Meetings.</li>
        <li>Help Desk meetings have been on hiatus in recent semesters. Please consult an FTE re: scheduling meetings, whether there are regular weekly meetings, and other special meetings. <strong>Attendance at all Help Desk meetings is mandatory. You must inform an FTE if you cannot attend.</strong></li>
        <li>The "Google Talk client" is Google Hangouts. It is not strictly required you have it open during your shift, but it is strongly recommended. It's often the best and fastest way to communicate with your FTEs (and for them to reach you and send you important info/links), and it's useful for sharing dank memes with your fellow Help Desk colleagues. Slack is also a useful messaging tool.</li>
    </ul>

   </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary style="font-size: 145%;">
        <strong>On Shift Expectations</strong>
    </summary>

    <p>
        While you are on shift there are certain things you need to do. This sounds much more work intensive than it really is, don't worry.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of these things are outlined in the <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/Policies_%26_Rules#On_Shift'>Wiki under Policies</a>. However this list is not all inclusive and could definitely be streamlined.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I'm going to do that...
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You will need to have all of the following pages/applications open and running on your browser
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    FootPrints (this must be visible)
                </li>
                <li>
                    LiveEngage (remeber to turn on notifications)
                </li>
                <li>
                    JAcT
                </li>
                <li>
                    CAEN Slack
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gmail
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Your phone must be off "Not Ready" while you are at your desk
            </li>
            <li>
                You will be expected to assign all unassigned tickets as well as respond to tickets in the SCE queues that you believe you can contribute to
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contributions can include providing solutions and answers to issues, requesting more information from the customers, contacting the team/FTE responsible for a ticket that has gone unanswered for an extended period of time, updating tickets with "thank you for your help" type messages to resolved status, or anything else you can do to positively impact the workflow of an active ticket.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should check the ticket queues at the start of each shift for any tickets that you can contribute to 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Check Teamwork for any new projects that you have been assigned to or that you can work on and keep your progress on assigned updated 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <summary style="font-size: 145%;">
        <strong>Tools</strong>
    </summary>
    <p>
        Be familiar with the various tools listed in this section. You will use them in most (if not all) of your shifts.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/Java_Account_Tool_%28JAcT%29'>JAcT (Java Account Tool)</a>: This tool enables easy access to account information for UM students and faculty (e.g. CAEN account and AFS storage status). Perhaps most importantly, JAcT allows you to make new CAEN accounts (<em>see "Accounts" section below</em>). Take special note of what to do to install or reinstall JAcT if you lose access to it (unfortunately, this tends to happen regularly).
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/FootPrints'>Footprints</a>: Footprints is the CAEN Ticket database. CAEN Tickets record the issues and reports CAEN receives and allow CAEN staff to communicate with relevant clients (via email). Clients can send tickets to the Help Desk via email (caen@umich.edu) or you can make your own Ticket for issues brought up by clients in-person, over the phone, or in a chat. Tickets are assigned to a relevant team who can assist the client with their issue; you and other CAEN employees can edit tickets and send emails to clients via the ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> As the Help Desk becomes more responsible for tickets, the way we use FootPrints is going to change. The above link is great for laying out the basic usage of FootPrints however it does not effectively cover how to actively handle issues that you have personally taken responsibiliity of. For information on how to best work with FootPrints and ensure you are following internal conventions when you are handling an issue please see the documentation on <a href='newFootPrintsUsage.html'>handling issues in FootPrints</a>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/LiveEngage'>LiveEngage</a>: LiveEngage is the chat tool CAEN uses to communicate with clients in a live chat. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='https://uofmcaen.slack.com'>CAEN Slack Channel</a>: Great way to quickly contact key staff from various CAEN teams and communicate wide-spread issues (also report a ticket, a Slack post is not a substitute for a reported ticket in the case of an outage), updates, questions, announcements, etc. with individual CAEN employees or CAEN at large. Good channels to follow include but are not limited to general, hotline, outages and random (the final is mostly for the memes). 
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='https://webservices.itcs.umich.edu/mediawiki/hotline/index.php/Phones'>Phones</a>: There are a lot of buttons on the Help Desk phones. Be sure to review here how each of them works. Always be calm and courteous when answering or making a phone call! Also, <em>don't forget to check <strong>voicemail</strong></em> if you're the one opening the Help Desk for the day.
        </li>
        <li>
            White Binders: You'll find important phone numbers, emergency contacts, info on each Footprints team, and other useful information in the White Binders scattered throughout the Help Desk. You should keep one at your desk and look through it to see what information is inside. You'll likely find yourself utilizing the binder often during your Help Desk career.
        </li>

    <summary style="font-size: 145%;">
        <strong>Accounts</strong>
    </summary>
    <p>
        Account creation is a very common and important task you will encounter as a Help Desk employee. Therefore, it is imperative that you understand how to create an account! 
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll need to consult the links below for a comprehensive discussion on different account types, account creation procedures, and account validation, but here are the key steps to remember: 
    </p>
    <p>
        Account Creation
        <ul>
            <li><strong> Student accounts must be made in-person (students must visit the Help Desk), and students must bring a valid MCard when they visit.</strong> You will mostly be making student accounts during your job.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check account eligibility. Check student class schedules on Wolverine Access (student account) or ask an FTE for proper documentation and approval (staff and visiting scholar accounts).</li>
            <li><strong>Always</strong> remind clients that it takes up to 1-2 business days for a CAEN Account to become fully active. Sometimes new account holders are unaware of this, and it can catch them by surprise. They can check if their account is ready by logging in to any CAEN computer with their standard UM Kerberos credentials (except the CAEN computers on the upper floors of the Dude, which are usable by all students).</li>
            <li>If a student gives you any trouble or pushback for the 1-2 day policy ("But I have a project due tonight at midnight!"), respectfully assert that we cannot guarantee the account will be ready any earlier. If you'd like, you can send a ticket or message to the Account Support team asking someone to expedite the approval (but again remind the client that there's no guarantee). Alternatively, all students can access the CAEN computers on the second and third floors of the Duderstadt Center, even without a valid CAEN account.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Account Validation
        <ul>
            <li> Each semester, accounts belonging to students and staff that no longer qualify for CAEN Accounts are marked for deletion. Relevant account holders are notified their accounts will be deleted via email. Sometimes accounts are marked for deletion in error (for example, a student taking a semester off UM courses to study abroad, but with intentions to return the following semester, may have their account deleted).</li>
            <li> Clients may contact the Help Desk with questions about their account, account deletion, and the account validation email.</li>
            <li> If a client believes that their account should not be deleted, be sure to check their availability and remind them they can contest the account deletion using a link in the validation email.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <strong>Software</strong>
    </summary>
    <p>
        There's a lot of software available on CAEN Machines. It's not uncommon for students to encounter issues accessing a particular program, find that a certain program is not available to them (due to limitations on usage defined by the license CAEN has acquired to use a program or user account restrictions). You should familiarize yourself with the links below to learn more about CAEN Software.

You may have encountered and/or used Linux before through Engineering courses or personal experience. As a Help Desk employee, you should know basic Linux commands, how to find whether CAEN Linux supports a particular software, and how to handle common problems clients might have with CAEN Linux. 
    </p>
    <p> Generally, for most software issues with Linux, assign a ticket to Software Support. For more general Linux issues (problems with the general OS as opposed to a specific program), there is a UNIX and Linux Systems Team.
