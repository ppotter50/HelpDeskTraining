<p>
	Welcome back to the Hotline. The first order of business...The Hotline is dead.
</p>
<p>
	Well not really dead so much as reborn from the ashes of what it used to be. We are now taking a much more active role in CAEN's backend (i.e. the stuff we used to call "above our pay grade"). What used to be the "CAEN Hotline" is now the "CAEN Help Desk" (*weeps uncontrollably*) and we are now a part of the Student Computing Environment (SCE) team. This is the team that contains the Software group the Windows Systems group and the Linux group, and we at the Help Desk will be responsible for working with the full time employees in these groups to solve the tickets that are assigned to them.
</p>
<p>
	As part of this absorption by the SCE team we are now under new management. Our new managers are Greg Baker (bakegreg), Katarina Lukaszewicz (katlukas) and Markus Nee (markusn) who are on the Windows Systems, Linux and Software teams respectively. You can email them with any questions, concerns or issues that come up. To reach all of them at once without using the cc function, you can send an email to caen-help-desk-supervisors@umich.edu.
</p>
<p>
	There are a few ways that the Help Desk works differently from the Hotline. First, and most importantly, we are now allowed (expected) to reply to tickets if we know the answer to the problem or if we find that the ticket contains insufficient information (ie. No host name of the computer, no lab location, etc.). We have also been added into the Software, Windows System and Linux Footprints group. Therefore, we are now also responsible for reading through the replies to the tickets in which we are assigned.  To find out more about how to handle tickets, please refer to: <a href='newFootPrintsUsage.html'>New Footprints Usage</a>
</p>
<p>
	Secondly, we will be assigned projects according to our current skills and interest. Most of the projects will be assigned to us on <a href='https://www.teamwork.com/'>Teamwork</a> and we can update our progress on the project, view the deadlines of the project, etc. using our Teamwork account. Projects can range from writing programs to software testing and they may be assigned to one specific person or the whole team. This also means that we will finally have something to do besides homework during the slow shifts at the Help Desk. <strong>Note:</strong> If you still don't have access to the CAEN Teamwork account, please email one (or all) of the managers to request access. 
</p>
<p>
	The phones have also been updated. You can find more information in the <a href="http://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/541">ITS documentation</a> and you can find all of the related links, passwords and so on in our <a href="phones.html">internal documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Last but not least, the Help Desk has <strong>MOVEd</strong> to the DC 2nd floor circulation desk and the ERB. So how exactly are we going to work at 2 places at once, you might ask. Well, right now we've decided to assign only one person to work at the circulation desk while the rest of us will be at the new office in the ERB. The person at the circulation desk will handle all the walk-ins (maybe phone calls as well) while the team in the ERB will handle phones, emails and chats. During busier periods, we might have two people at the circulation desk but nothing has been set in stone. Please feel free to provide suggestions if you have a more efficient system of placing people/assigning work. The move is supposed to happen sometime in October (allegedly).
