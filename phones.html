	The phones at the Help Desk have been upgraded (YAY!). Gone are the days of the ancient, yellowing Graham Bell machines, we are now living in the future.
</p>

<p>
	Here in the future we provide <a href="http://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/541">documentation</a> so that you may properly use and operate the tools made available to you.
</p>

<p>
	As explained in this documentation you will have to log into a <a href="https://ccmipcc1al.ns.itd.umich.edu:8445/desktop/container/?locale=en_US">Cisco site</a> to use these phones. Follow this link and log in with the information provided on the lables adhered to the front of the phone. If there are no labels present the ID is the phones phone number (top right corner), the password is 14172859, and the extention is the phones extention (number to the right of the lower phone icon).
